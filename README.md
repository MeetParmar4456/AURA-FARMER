## üöÄ Getting Started

This project offers two ways to play: a simple executable for gamers and a source code setup for developers.

### üéÆ Easy Installation (Recommended for Players)

For the quickest way to start playing, you can use the pre-packaged executable.

1.  Navigate to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/MeetParmar4456/AURA-FARMER/releases)** of this repository.

### üíª Installation from Source (For Developers)

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your machine:
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* MySQL Connector/J library (e.g., `mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar`)

#### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MeetParmar4456/AURA-FARMER.git](https://github.com/MeetParmar4456/AURA-FARMER.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the source directory:**
    ```bash
    cd AURA-FARMER/aurafarmer_final/src/main/java
    ```

3.  **Compile the project**:
    Run the following command from the `java` directory. Make sure to replace `path/to/` with the actual path to your MySQL connector `.jar` file.
    ```bash
    javac -cp ".:path/to/mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar" com/aurafarmer/Main.java com/aurafarmer/model/*.java com/aurafarmer/service/*.java com/aurafarmer/util/*.java com/aurafarmer/commands/*.java com/aurafarmer/menus/*.java com/aurafarmer/db/*.java

    ```
